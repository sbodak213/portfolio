basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth

This website was developed in my Web Typography class for the purpose
of having this site added to my portfolio. My teacher gave me the option 
to use a starter code but I decided to build the site from scratch. 
This will be an ongoing project because I will have future projects 
that I will want to add to my site.

The site mostly contains html and css coding. Building this site was 
complex but enjoyable. I learned a lot of new things about coding and how 
intricate it can be. I hope you enjoy the site.
